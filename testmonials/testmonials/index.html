                                for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.

                    Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!

                    <h5 class="px-4 my-4"> “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
                        professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                        student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and
                        staff
                        did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile
                        team
                        project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no
                        tutorial
                        could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
                        experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple
                        offers.
                        100% recommend! ” </h5>
